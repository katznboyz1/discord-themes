# discord-themes
Just a few discord themes that I've made for fun.

*How to install these:* **Once you have downloaded the files from this repository, copy them to** ***%appdata%\\BetterDiscord\\themes*** **or if you arent on windows, then copy the files to the path of your BetterDiscord themes folder. Once the css files are in the themes folder, then open up discord and then go into Settings>Themes and then select the file that you want to use. To do this, you have to be using BetterDiscord, which can be downloaded from their site.**
